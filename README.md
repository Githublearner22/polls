The official Django tutorial application

Step by step follow along tutorial on getting started with Django. Went back to refresh on Django as it is a difficult to understand the innerworkings of the application.

Learning to get into habit of reading documentation. I used to just read guidance from google and secondary sources of information. 

I have used Pycharm professional for the first time. It is very laggy on my laptop. Looking to change that.
